title: Interview with Women Go Tech about my career in online payments
---

This is not exactly something I've written. I just answered some questions about my career as backend software engineer in the Payments domain. I was asked to do this as I was one of the mentors at Women Go Tech program (a mentoring program in Lithuania dedicated to helping women start and accelerate their careers in IT and engineering). You can find the interview [here](https://www.womengotech.lt/career-in-online-payments-part-2-ieva-grazuleviciute-backend-developer-at-vinted/).
