title: (Backend) Engineer Hiring Process @ Vinted
---

When I just joined Vinted I got involved with different initiatives to get to know the people, processes and culture there. One of those initiatives was the review of our hiring process. While working on it I saw an article by Julia Evans ["Tell candidates what to expect from your interview process"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/30/tell-candidates-what-to-expect-from-your-job-interviews/). Since I had fresh experience of Vinted hiring process from both sides I decided to write an article about it for Vinted's engineering blog. Here it is: [(Backend) Engineer Hiring Process](https://vinted.engineering/2020/09/21/backend_engineer_hiring_process/)
