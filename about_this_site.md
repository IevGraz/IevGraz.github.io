# About this site

You can find a longer version of how this site came to be [here](/2021/09/12/how_this_site_came_to_be.html). But long story short, I have a passion for learning about my craft (software engineering). Mostly by reading books and watching courses. As the number of things I read and other professional experiences is increasing, I find myself wanting to share them with my colleagues. So I made this site to be able to put all things in one place:

- The things [I read](/book_reviews.html)
- The things [I watch](/reviews.html)
- And the things I experience and decide to [write](/posts.html ) about.
