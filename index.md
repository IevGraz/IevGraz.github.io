I've been a backend software engineer since 2017. Before that I had the chance to try on the roles of research lab assistant (in the field of nonlinear optics) and quality assurance specialist (working with both manual and automated testing). As a software engineer I specialise in payments domain, having worked for the payments teams in [MobilePay](https://www.mobilepay.dk/about-us) and [Vinted](https://vinted.engineering/). In these jobs I have: 

- Worked with both **micro-service** (including messaging, event-sourcing, domain driven design patterns) and **monolithic** architectures;
- Worked with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** (Cassandra) databases;
- Worked with both statically (**C#**) and dynamically (**Ruby**) typed languages;
- Worked in co-located and cross-border (LTU-DK) teams;
- Worked in cross-functional and backend-only teams;
- Participated in different stages of hiring process (from defining the process itself to reviewing homework and conducting interviews)
- Participated in organizing software development internships and mentoring students.
