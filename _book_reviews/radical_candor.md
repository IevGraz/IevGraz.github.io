__Why I read it:__  It is considered a good read in the company I work for. Was curious why. 

__What I liked about it:__  The first part of the book that presented the different models of interaction â€“ radical candour, obnoxious aggression, ruinous empathy and manipulative insincerity. I think it was the first time I actually thought about how wanting to be nice and liked can be damaging to team dynamics and work efficiency. As well as the importance of personal relationship to successful leadership. I think coming across these two ideas really expanded my mind. Other than that got some practical tips on setting career goals in ways that would satisfy both personal and company needs. And I always like books that give some insight to the life of famous Silicon Valley companies. 

__What I disliked:__ The second part of the book. The actionable tips for managers. These were far away from my life as individual contributor and therefore quite boring.
