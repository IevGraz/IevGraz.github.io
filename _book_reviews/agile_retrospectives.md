__Why I read it:__ I wanted to arrange a kind of retrospective I’ve once participated in for my current team and this book has the guidelines for it. 

__What I liked about it:__ It was short and on point. It detailed stages of retrospective, explained why they are needed and gave a lot of different activities for implementing each stage. That has few benefits: you can choose what activities would fit you and your team best, you don’t have to read the things that are not relevant at the moment and it is easy to get back to them if and when they become relevant. Plus it had few chapters on being a good retrospective leader/ moderator. These things do not come naturally to me and the tips were super useful. 

__What I disliked:__ There wasn’t anything particular I disliked, but I just don’t feel like giving it 5 stars. It just didn’t really bring me joy. It was a necessity read to get the information.
